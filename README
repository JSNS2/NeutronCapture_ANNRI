for neutron capture simulation

============================================================================
Important note
Some files cannot be uploaded in "GitHub" due to file size limitation

Pleas copy them from "/home/mlf/cdshin/RAT/jsns2/externalVer/ext_gamma_gen/JSNS2_ANNRI_Gd/cont_dat" in KEKCC 
============================================================================


1. Need to simulate neutron events using RAT
- This does not include "RAT"
- Please use your own "RAT"
- Please refer to "thermalN.mac"
- tracking option must be turned on

2. Making gammas from neutron capture information
- From step1, only capture information will be extracted. (capture postion, and materials)
- After that gammas will be generated by this code
- Compile
  >> it will require "RAT" and "ROOT" library
  >> make clean
  >> make 

- reGeneration_nGd_gamma.cc
  >> please modify for input and output file
  >> input files are "ouput files of step1"
  >> output files will have same format of the external input file of "RAT"
  >> How to run? 
    >>> refer to "RunSingle.sh"

3. RAT simulation using output files of step2
